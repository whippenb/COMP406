= Open Source Development

== Agenda

=== May 8. Lab 1: Prequiz

Pull from me:

----
cd ~/COMP406
# The easy way
git pull upstream master
# The leet way
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master
# See a CONFLICT? Unlikely at this point
git mergetool
----

Open up `prequiz.adoc` in your favorite text editor (it is in your local git repository).

WARNING: Do not use Notepad or Word.
Use a real text editor. Suggestions:
http://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v6.7.7.html[Notepad++] (Windows),
https://atom.io/[Atom],
or http://www.sublimetext.com/[Sublime].

Then, save your changes and submit your work to your repository.

----
cd ~/COMP406
# The easy way
git gui &
# The leet way
git add .
git commit -m "Finished prequiz"
git push -u --all origin

=== May 6. Git and hosting setup

Step 1. Install Git and frontends

[[install-git]]
Windows:: http://sourceforge.net/projects/gitextensions/[Install Git Extensions]
+
NOTE: Install MsysGit, Install KDiff, and *choose OpenSSH* (not PuTTY); otherwise,
stick to the default settings.
+

image:http://lawrancej.github.io/starterupper/images/openssh.png[Choose OpenSSH]

Mac OS X:: http://rowanj.github.io/gitx/[Install GitX-dev], then https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/[Install XCode developer tools] which ships with git (recommended) or http://git-scm.com/download/mac[install git from here].

Linux:: http://git-scm.com/download/linux[Install git] using your package manager.
http://sourceforge.net/projects/qgit/[QGit, a git frontend] may also be available for your distribution.
+
NOTE: Don't forget to use +sudo+ with your package manager.

== Readings

TIP: *Carefully read the first sentence of every paragraph before deciding
whether to skip or read the rest of the paragraph, since writers often
state the point upfront and then support it in subsequent sentences.*
In short, you can read quickly with high comprehension by skipping the
supporting material, if you understand the writer's point and how they write.
Of course, if you don't understand the point, then read everything carefully,
but beware of poorly written supporting material that distracts you.
Obviously, skipping later sentences doesn't always work: not all documents
fit the "topic sentence followed by supporting points" structure of essays.
For example, narratives often instead have dialogue among characters,
but those are even easier to read quickly than large walls of text.
Sometimes, bad writers put in pointless filler that doesn't go anywhere,
or even worse, bury the point in the middle of the paragraph.
Good writers understand their audience and know that to get
people to read their work, they must make their work easy to skim.
Now pause for a second: did you see what I just did here?
If you were thinking, this paragraph is itself a giant wall of text,
I could have ignored the rest, and then realized that this is all a
bit meta, then you not only understand the definition of the
word meta, but you also ignored my advice about how to speed
read, proving that you are kind of person who does the reading completely.
Obviously, reading the whole paragraph gives you some nuance that can be
rewarding, but then again, I think we can agree that the first sentence
captured the rest of this paragraph pretty well, which is why you should
have just skipped this paragraph full of inane, distracting filler.
